# chevron.introspector

A way to look into a PHP value. In particular this will describe a PHP object
without reverence to the visibility of it's properties. This was written as a serializer
that didn't choke on Closures (that can't be serialized).

Peruse the tests or, if present, the examples directory to see usage.

See [packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/henderjon/chevron-introspector) for version/installation info. At the moment, I recommend using `~1.0`.
